# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is intended as an aid for those in the UCF Fullstack developer bootcamp. This project was built from the ground up to explore and develop skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
and git. In completing the project I got a working viewpoint on git, refreshed my CLI skills, and began to remember how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript function together.
